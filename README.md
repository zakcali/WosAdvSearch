# WosAdvSearch
Web of Science AdvancedSearch Query Creator for Universities
# Introduction
Web of Science is an indexing service for quality scientific publications worldwide. If you have an ip access, usually in an university campus area, you can search for publications and citations online at their web site: http://apps.webofknowledge.com/
"Basic Search" option can be redirected from html forms, described and accessed here: http://wokinfo.com/webtools/searchbox/

Unfortunately, there isn't any form (at least I couldn't find) for "Advanced Search" option. You must go to, http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ click "Advanced Search" option, enter search terms, and click Search button.
If you don't search regulary, and know what to do this procedure is okay. But if you want to search for a lot of authors, or search for a lot of departments in an university, this is waste of time.  
Those links decribe, what how to use advanced search: http://images.webofknowledge.com/WOKRS534DR1/help/WOS/hp_advanced_search.html
and http://images.webofknowledge.com/WOKRS534DR1/help/WOS/hp_advanced_examples.html

Web of Science has an SOAP api,named WokSearchLite the traget file is http://search.webofknowledge.com/esti/wokmws/ws/WokSearchLite and, you can access it within campus.
Here are online and pdf versions of documentation: http://help.incites.clarivate.com/wosWebServicesLite/WebServicesLiteOverviewGroup/Introduction.html and 
https://www.recursoscientificos.fecyt.es/sites/default/files/web_of_science_web_services_3_0.pdf
and here are presentaitons from Clarivate Analytics about WOS APIs: https://www.e-nformation.ro/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/APIs.pdf and https://wok.mimas.ac.uk/support/documentation/presentations/api1018.pdf and https://bg.pw.edu.pl/images/OIN/Omega_PSIR/Web_of_Science_and_Incites_data_Integration_Clarivate_Analytics.pdf

The hard way to use this api is, to use some api tools, as described here: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march16/li/App2-WebServicesSetup.pdf
and here: https://sc.lib.miamioh.edu/bitstream/handle/2374.MIA/6053/SOAP%20-%20Publisher%27s%20Version-LHTN-08-2015-0059.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

Best way is create a tool like http://wokinfo.com/webtools/searchbox/ and supply this tool with prepared query lists.

There are Python source codes for querying wos programmatically, such as https://github.com/enricobacis/wos , https://github.com/karthik/RRR and https://github.com/MSU-Libraries/wos

Since my university supply me a server with php capabilities, I had to find php source codes, like https://gist.github.com/pol/1321660 and https://gist.github.com/domoritz/2012629

New Beta page of Web of Science allows advanced search by linking url's. url contains an encrypted text and added to thta link: "https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/general-summary?q="

# Logic
There are 3 horizontal tabs.

1- First  tab finds publications from various indexes, and also creates queries for Web of Science Advanced Search Tab.

departments and associated queries are red from the file named: department-list.csv, by using php script as follows
json_encode(file_get_contents('department-list.csv')); 

and parsed with papaparse.min.js library, source: https://www.papaparse.com

then a clickable menu, containing departments and associated queries is created with html select tag 

When user selects a department from list, associated query text is copied to a textarea, named wosQuery, id is searchText

Now user has tree options:

a) By clicking the button, below the textarea, http://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_AdvancedSearch_input.do?&product=WOS&search_mode=AdvancedSearch page is opened in a new tab, and clipboard contains the query text. User must paste query text to search area, and click Search button in Web of Science site himself

b) By clicking the button, above the textarea, wos-retrieve.php function is called. This php script queries on the server side by using WokSearchLite api, and creates an output containing publications, and links to publications and citations.

c) By clicking the second button, below the textarea, and encrypted queryText added to that url "https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/general-summary?q=" and a publication list displayed automatically in a new pad. There is no need to paste a query text for new Web of Science Beta page.
